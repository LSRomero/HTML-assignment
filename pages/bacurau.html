    <h4>2019 - Original title: Bacurau <br>
        Directors: Juliano Dornelles and Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho</h4>
    <p>After the death of her grandmother, Teresa comes home to her matriarchal village in a near-future Brazil to find a succession of sinister events that mobilizes all of its residents.</p>
    <p>One of the best filmic distillations of that impending 21st-century sense of doom, a concentrated vision of the apocalypse that somehow manages to strike a hopeful note</p>
